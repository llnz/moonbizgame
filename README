-----

Check out the code from git.

It is strongly recommended to use a virtual environment to develop in. Using virtualenvwrapper:

    mkvirtualenv moonbizgame

Install the required packages

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
Create a localsettings.py file

    cp moonbizgame/localsettings.py.in moonbizgame/localsettings.py

Edit the localsettings.py file to suit. In particular, setting the `DATABASE`, `STATICFILES_DIRS`,
`TEMPLATE_DIRS`, and `SECRET_KEY`.

After setting up the database, you should be able to run the app.

    ./manage.py syncdb
    ./manage.py migrate
    
    ./manage.py runserver

The site is then available on http://localhost:8000/
